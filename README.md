# Requirements
* Laminar's Cessna 172SP with the G1000
* [X-Plane 12](https://www.x-plane.com/) only
* [FlyWithLua 2.8 for X-Plane 12](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/82888-flywithlua-ng-next-generation-plus-edition-for-x-plane-12-win-lin-mac/)
* [Yawman Arrow Controller](https://yawmanflight.com/)

# Installation
Note that the current script does not modify your axes. You'll need to set up your Yawman Arrow's axes as you like.

Save _LR C172SP G1000 Yawman Multipress.lua_ to /X-Plane 12/Resources/plugins/FlyWithLua/Scripts

See Yawman's [discord](https://discord.gg/dcpTc5KP).

But the wheel is trim by default. However, I have made it move a bit faster with the wheel. Pitch up and down with the POV up and down works, but they're for fine adjustments.

# Assignments are In Work!
Sixpack 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are referred to as SP1, SP2, SP3 etc. These are the two rows of three buttons, where the upper-most left button is 1 and the lower-most right button is 6.

Some Yawman documentation refer to these as MF 1L (SP1), MF 1C (SP2), MF 1R (SP3), MF 2L (SP4), MF 2C (SP5), MF 2R (SP6)
